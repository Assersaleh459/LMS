## 1. Database migrations (`supabase/migrations/`)

| # | File | What it does |

| 026 | fix_conduct_audit_and_announcements | `fn_audit_conduct` read nonexistent `entry_type` (→ `category`); `announcements.target_grade` if missing |

`supabase/seed.sql` seeds مدرسة الفارابي للغات with all roles, subjects, a term, sample grades + attendance.

## 2. Edge functions (`supabase/functions/`)

| Function | Purpose | Auth |
|----------|---------|------|
| `admin-create-user` | Create login-capable user via Admin API; optional password (default `Madrasati@2025`); requires email | school_admin/it_admin/chain_admin |
| `admin-reset-password` | Reset a user's password; logs to audit | school_admin/it_admin only |
| `emergency-broadcast` | Send message to all parents | admin |
| `notify-absence` | WhatsApp alert for absent students | ⚠️ placeholder URL |
| `notify-assignment` | WhatsApp alert on assignment publish | ⚠️ placeholder URL |
| `notify-grade` | WhatsApp alert on grade entry | ⚠️ placeholder URL |

## 3. Features by role

**School Admin** (`/admin`): dashboard with school-health score + at-risk panel, user management (create/edit/CSV import/password reset/custom-role assign), class roster, teacher-subject assignment, timetable editor, academic-year/term rollover, absence report, emergency broadcast, school settings, **system audit log** (`/admin/audit`), **roles & permissions** (`/admin/permissions`, incl. custom role creation).

**Teacher** (`/teacher`): dashboard (class count, absent today, ungraded subs), attendance (offline queue + WhatsApp), grade entry (written/oral/practical/activity; KG = descriptive ممتاز/جيد/يحتاج تحسين; Excel import/export; audit; analytics), assignments (6 types + rubric builder), submissions grading (rubric scorer), courses→units→lessons→quizzes (+ question bank + course copy), conduct log, profile.

**Students** — Primary (`/student/primary`), Secondary (`/student/secondary`, Thanawi 40/60 weighted), KG (`/student/kg`, descriptive only): grades view, timetable, assignments (submit text/photo), courses, quizzes (with availability window + attempt limit).

**Parent** (`/parent`): child switcher, grades, 90-day attendance calendar, upcoming assignments, teacher messaging (realtime), printable report card (logo + MoE code + signatures), logout in header.

**Chain Admin** (`/chain`) / **MoE Supervisor** (read-only nav): cross-school stats.
**IT Admin** (`/it-admin`): system health overview.

## 4. Key file map

| Area | Files |
|------|-------|
| Auth | `src/app/providers/AuthProvider.tsx`, `src/features/auth/LoginPage.tsx`, `ResetPasswordPage.tsx` (self-service reset is BLOCKED — contact admin) |
| i18n | `src/lib/i18n.ts` |
| Permissions | `src/hooks/usePermissions.ts`, `src/features/admin/PermissionsPage.tsx` |
| Audit | `src/features/admin/SystemAuditPage.tsx` |
| Users | `src/features/admin/UserManagementPage.tsx` |
| Grade logic | `src/lib/supabase.ts` (`enterGrade`), `src/lib/moe.ts` (letter grades, KG grades, Thanawi calc) |
| Nav | `src/components/layout/{SideNav,BottomNav,AppBar}.tsx` (AppBar has logout + lang toggle for all pages) |
| Routes | `src/app/Router.tsx` |

## 5. Auth / login decisions
- Google sign-in: **removed**.
- Self-service "forgot password": **removed/blocked** — only school_admin & it_admin reset passwords (via `admin-reset-password`).
- Logout: shown on every page (AppBar reads `auth.session`; ParentDashboard has its own header button).

## 6. Remaining / untested work
1. **WhatsApp integration** (ON HOLD per user) — wire `notify-*` to real n8n or WhatsApp Business API.
2. Real-user testing pass — test banks, rubrics, course copy, at-risk, quiz availability are built but unverified in real use.
3. PWA push when app closed.
4. Regenerate `src/types/database.ts` to drop the `(supabase as any)` casts (optional cleanup).
5. Security follow-ups after 025: quiz `correct_answer` still readable by students and scored client-side (move scoring server-side); `submissions` storage bucket is public; `admin-create-user` can create `chain_admin`/`moe_supervisor`; routes check login only, not role; `emergency-broadcast` / `notify-*` don't verify the caller.
